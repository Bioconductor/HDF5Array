Package: HDF5Array
Title: Array-like containers for convenient access and manipulation of HDF5
	datasets
Description: This package implements the HDF5Array and HDF5Matrix classes
	for convenient access and manipulation of HDF5 datasets. Operations on
	HDF5Array and HDF5Matrix objects are implemented as delayed operations
	and/or via a block processing strategy in order to optimize performance
	and reduce memory usage. These mechanisms are implemented by the
	DelayedArray and DelayedMatrix classes, and are independent of the
	backend (they even work on ordinary arrays where they can sometimes
	improve performance).
