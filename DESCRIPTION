Package: HDF5Array
Title: HDF5 backend for DelayedArray objects
Description: Implements the HDF5Array and TENxMatrix classes, 2 convenient
	and memory-efficient array-like containers for on-disk representation
	of HDF5 datasets. HDF5Array is for datasets that use the conventional
	(i.e. dense) HDF5 representation. TENxMatrix is for datasets that
	use the HDF5-based sparse matrix representation from 10x Genomics
	(e.g. the 1.3 Million Brain Cell Dataset). Both containers being
	DelayedArray extensions, they support all operations supported by
	DelayedArray objects. These operations can be either delayed or
	block-processed.
