Package: HDF5Array
Title: An array-like container for convenient access and manipulation of HDF5
	datasets
Description: This package implements the HDF5Array class for convenient access
	and manipulation of HDF5 datasets. In order to reduce memory usage and
	optimize performance, operations on an HDF5Array object are either
	delayed or executed using a block processing mechanism.
	The delaying and block processing mechanisms are independent of the
	on-disk backend and implemented via the DelayedArray class. They even
	work on ordinary arrays where they can sometimes improve performance.
