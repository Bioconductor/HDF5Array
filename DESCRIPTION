Package: HDF5Array
Title: Array-like containers for convenient access and manipulation of HDF5
	datasets
Description: This package implements the HDF5Array class for convenient access
	and manipulation of HDF5 datasets. In order to reduce memory usage and
	optimize performance, operations on an HDF5Array object are either
	delayed or performed using a block processing mechanism.
	The delaying and block processing mechanisms are implemented via the
	DelayedArray class and independent of the on-disk backend. They even
	work on ordinary arrays where they can sometimes improve performance.
