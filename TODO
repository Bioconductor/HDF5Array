dimnames
--------

- Store the dimnames in the HDF5 file: investigate the possiblity to store the
  dimnames in the HDF5 file so the HDF5ArraySeed() and HDF5Array() constructors
  can grab them from there. According to the HDF5 spec, it seems that the best
  way to do this is by storing the dimnames in HDF5 Dimension Scale datasets
  (1 dataset per character vector in the list returned by dimnames(x)):

    https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/Tutor/h5dimscale.html

  Operations that write a new HDF5 dataset to disk (e.g. matrix multiplication,
  or coercion to HDF5ArraySeed or HDF5Array) would then need to be modified to
  also write the dimnames to the HDF5 file.

Other things
------------

- Keep investigating interaction between chunk and block geometries and their
  impact on block processing performance.

- Add 'chunk' slot to HDF5ArraySeed objects and populate it with physical chunk
  geometry at creation time. Emit a warning if chunk genometry won't lead to
  good block processing performance.

- Do some benchmarking (with special attention to memory usage).

- Add more unit tests.
