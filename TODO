- Complete man pages.

- Add vignette.

- Store the dimnames in the HDF5 file: investigate the possiblity to store the
  dimnames in the HDF5 file so the HDF5Dataset() and HDF5Array() constructors
  can grab them from there. Operations that write a new HDF5 dataset to disk
  (e.g. matrix multiplication, or HDF5Dataset() when called on a DelayedArray)
  would need to be modified to also write the dimnames to the HDF5 file.

- Support more matrix- and array-like operations.

- Add more unit tests.
