Store the dimnames in the HDF5 file
===================================

Investigate the possiblity to store the dimnames in the HDF5 file so the
HDF5Array() constructor can grab them from there. Methods that write a new
HDF5 dataset to disk (e.g. coercion from array to HDF5Array) would need to
be modified to also write the dimnames to the HDF5 file.
