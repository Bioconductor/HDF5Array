- Document global option HDF5Array.block.size

- Fix bug in "[" method for DelayedArray objects caused by "substitute() +
  eval()" hack. See R/DelayedArray-class.R for the details.

- Store the dimnames in the HDF5 file: investigate the possiblity to store the
  dimnames in the HDF5 file so the HDF5Dataset() and HDF5Array() constructors
  can grab them from there. According to the HDF5 spec, it seems that the best
  way to do this is by storing the dimnames in HDF5 Dimension Scale datasets
  (1 dataset per character vector in the list returned by dimnames(x)):

    https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/Tutor/h5dimscale.html

  Operations that write a new HDF5 dataset to disk (e.g. matrix multiplication,
  or HDF5Dataset() when called on a DelayedArray) would then need to be
  modified to also write the dimnames to the HDF5 file.

- Keep investigating interaction between chunk and block geometries and their
  impact on block processing performance.

- Add 'chunk' slot to HDF5Dataset objects and populate it with physical chunk
  geometry at creation time. Emit a warning if chunk genometry won't lead to
  good block processing performance.

- Add more examples to the man pages (using the toy dataset).

- Add unit tests for round() and signif() (Math2 group).

- Add vignette.

- Do some benchmarking (with special attention to memory usage).

- Support more matrix- and array-like operations.

- How well supported are DelayedArray of type "character"?

- Add more unit tests.
