- Fix bug in "[" method for DelayedArray objects caused by "substitute() +
  eval()" hack. See R/DelayedArray-class.R for the details.

- Keep investigating interaction between chunk and block geometries and their
  impact on block processing performance.

- Add 'chunk' slot to HDF5Dataset objects and populate it with physical chunk
  geometry at creation time. Emit a warning if chunk genometry won't lead to
  good block processing performance.

- Store the dimnames in the HDF5 file: investigate the possiblity to store the
  dimnames in the HDF5 file so the HDF5Dataset() and HDF5Array() constructors
  can grab them from there. Operations that write a new HDF5 dataset to disk
  (e.g. matrix multiplication, or HDF5Dataset() when called on a DelayedArray)
  would need to be modified to also write the dimnames to the HDF5 file.

- Add more examples to the man pages (using the toy dataset).

- Add unit tests for round() and signif() (Math2 group).

- Add vignette.

- Do some benchmarking (with special attention to memory usage).

- Support more matrix- and array-like operations.

- How well supported are DelayedArray of type "character"?

- Add more unit tests.
