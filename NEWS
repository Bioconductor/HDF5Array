CHANGES IN VERSION 1.10.0
-------------------------

NEW FEATURES

    o Implement the TENxMatrix container (DelayedArray backend for the
      HDF5-based sparse matrix representation used by 10x Genomics).
      Also add writeTENxMatrix() and coercion to TENxMatrix.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o By default automatic HDF5 datasets (e.g. the dataset that gets written
      to disk when calling 'as(x, "HDF5Array")') now are created with chunks
      of 1 million array elements (revious default was 1/75 of
      'getAutoBlockLength(x)'). This can be controlled with new low-level
      utilities get/setHDF5DumpChunkLength().

    o By default automatic HDF5 datasets now are created with chunks of
      shape "scale" instead of "first-dim-grows-first". This can be
      controlled with new low-level utilities get/setHDF5DumpChunkShape().

    o getHDF5DumpChunkDim() looses the 'type' and 'ratio' arguments (only 'dim'
      is left).
